Intro: Hi guys, at age of 35 finally exploring my nerd side and enjoying it. What an interesting world !

- I learned SQL for my work (pulling Cloud data -> making analyses & dashboards)
- I have gone through quite some amounts of training in Python - but still feeling absolute beginner .. 
- I have been learning about (mostly copy-editing) all kinds of programs (emailing programs, chatbots, scraping, ..) and ML learning projects (from basic LR to face recognition and reinforcement learning)
- I have built some basic php websites and e-commerce with Django scraping 100 websites on daily basis
- I play around with arduino projects
