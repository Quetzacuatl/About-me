First repository

my first commit:
Intro: Hi guys, at age of 35 finally exploring my nerd side and enjoying it. What an interesting world ! 
(Background: Education : Master in Life Sciences (o-o) and then turned to Master in Applied Sciences. Work : Sales analyst, Financial analyst, Master data manager, project manager, data analyst. So as you can see, I Luckely found my way from finance to data & coding 

- I learned SQL for my work (pulling Cloud data -> making analyses & dashboards)
- I have gone through quite some amounts of training in Python - but still feeling absolute beginner .. 
- I have been learning about (mostly copy-editing) all kinds of programs (emailing programs, chatbots, scraping, ..) and ML learning projects (from basic LR to face recognition and reinforcement learning)
- I have built some basic php websites and e-commerce with Python and Django scraping 100 shops on daily basis
- I play around with arduino projects
- Interest in exploring blockchain (Cardano - Plutus - Haskell smart contracts)

Besides the SQL and some basic python I use for work, the majority of my hours that go into this is pure hobby and passion. 
I have NO experience at all in building production ready tools, work in teams etc .. but if there is interest and a way on how to start contributing to projects I would be happy and humble to join forces.
